Procedure to filter points that are inside a polygon.

### 0. Load the environment ###

The numpy, astropy and argparse python modules are required. The latter one is already available with python 2.7.x.

Example: load environment on agile cluster gtbc4.giano.iasfbo
    module load python2.7-sci

### 1. The polygon file ###

A polygon/contour file has to be defined as a series of vertices in radec coordinates or galactic coordinates in counter-clockwise order. The last vertex and the first vertex of the list are connected, do redefine the first vertex two times or remove the duplicate vertex if present.

Example: A "square.con" polygon

0.0 0.0
0.0 1.0
1.0 1.0
1.0 0.0

### 2. Filter points inside a polygon ###

Command:

    polygonfilter.py [-h] [-g] [-l L] [-b B] polygon points output

    positional arguments:
      polygon           An input file containing the polygon as a list of vertices
                        (default radec, see -g)
      points            An input file containing a list of points to test
                        (galactic coords only)
      output            An output file containing only the points inside the
                        polygon

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help        show this help message and exit
      -g, -galactic     The input contour unit is galactic coordinates
      -l L, -lcolumn L  l column number inside the list of points file (default 0)
      -b B, -bcolumn B  b column number inside the list of points file (default 1)

Example: Filter two points inside the square contour

Considering the square.con file defined before as radec coordinates and the following points.txt file:
    "0.5 0.5"
    "-1 0.5"
    "0.0 1.1"

    $AGILE/scripts/polygonfilter/polygonfilter.py square.con points.txt points_filtered.txt
